#Session 2

""" This repository contains the excerises based on what we covered in Session 2. The excersises are as follow:

#Exercise 1: FizzBuzz

Write a FizzBuzz Function: Create a function fizzbuzz(n) that takes an integer n as a parameter.

Implement FizzBuzz Logic: The function should print:

"Fizz" for multiples of 3 ○ "Buzz" for multiples of 5 ○ "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5 ○ The number itself for other numbers

Call the Function: Call the function for numbers 1 to 20.


#Exercise 2: Basic Data Filtering

Create a List of Mixed Data Types: Create a list that contains a mix of integers, strings, and floats.
Filter the List: Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the integers from the original list.
Print the New List: Output the filtered list of integers.


#Exercise 3: Simple To-Do List

Create an Empty List: Start with an empty list called todo_list.
Define Functions: ○ A function add_task(task) that adds a task to the list. ○ A function show_tasks() that prints all tasks in the list.


#Exercise 4: Temperature Converter

Define a Conversion Function: Write a function celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius) that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Print the Result: Output the converted temperature for 22ºF, 46ºF, 51ºF and 76ºF
